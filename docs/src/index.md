# Integrals.jl: Unified Integral Approximation Interface

Integrals.jl is a unified interface for the numerical approximation of integrals
(quadrature) in Julia. It interfaces with other packages of the Julia ecosystem
to make it easy to test alternative solver packages and pass small types to
control algorithm swapping.

## Installation

To install Integrals.jl, use the Julia package manager:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("Integrals")
```
